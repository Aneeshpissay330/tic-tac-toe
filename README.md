# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Overview

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in React and Tailwind CSS. It allows two players to play against each other, taking turns to place their marks (X and O) on a 3x3 grid. The game automatically checks for a winner after each move and draws a line across the winning combination. If the game ends in a draw, it also displays the result.

## Features

- **Two-Player Game**: Players take turns to place their marks on the grid.
- **Winning Line**: A line is drawn across the winning combination when a player wins.
- **Draw Detection**: The game detects when the match ends in a draw.
- **Responsive UI**: The game grid is responsive and adjusts to different screen sizes.
- **Play Again**: Players can reset the game and start a new match.
